<h1> A Love Letter to Zane</h1>
<br></br>
<h2>Dear Zane</h2>
<br></br>
<p1>From the moment our paths crossed, something within me awakened. I never knew how powerful a single glance could be until I looked into your eyes. Your laughter is like music to my ears, a melody that plays on repeat in my mind long after we part. Every thought of you sends butterflies fluttering in my stomach, and I find myself daydreaming about all the moments we could share.</p1>
<br></br>
<p1>You are not just beautiful on the outside; it’s the kindness in your heart, the passion in your soul, and the way you see the world that captivates me. Your strength inspires me to be better, and your joy is contagious. I admire how you light up a room and how you make everyone around you feel special. Just thinking about you brings a smile to my face and warmth to my heart.</p1>
<br></br>

<p1>I often catch myself lost in thoughts of our future—imagining adventures, quiet moments, and laughter that echoes through the years. I want to be there to support you in all your dreams and to celebrate the little victories together. You deserve all the happiness in the world, and I wish to be a part of that journey.</p1>
<br></br>

<p1>As my feelings for you continue to deepen, I find myself hoping you feel the same. I cherish every moment we spend together and look forward to creating countless memories. You’ve become such an important part of my life.</p1>
<br></br>

With all my love,  
SP
